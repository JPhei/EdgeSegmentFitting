# EdgeSegmentFitting
-----------------------------------------------------------
Edge linking and edge segment drawing
-----------------------------------------------------------

TO-DO:
Done writing, now test maxlinedev. Start writing lineseg (form straight line segments from an edge list) which uses maxlinedev. Lists of arrays in Python will hold all the edge segments and the output from lineseg will also be a list of arrays. Each array will have a list of points, and every two points form a line segment.

Further ahead: 
- Write Queue for Predictive walk to create line segments and other related functions.
