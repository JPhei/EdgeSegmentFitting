# EdgeSegmentFitting
-----------------------------------------------------------
Edge linking and edge segment drawing
-----------------------------------------------------------

TO-DO:
- Finish writing edge segment creation and find way to change pixels at coord. 
- Make some of the code more modular since there are many repeats. 
- Look through Walk8Dirs to see what each pixel direction move does and find a way to split it into modules. 
- Consider using Cython to make the already written code work with the C++ code. 
- Learn how to compile Python scripts via Cython.



Further ahead: 
- unit tests for each function

Done:
- maxlinedev
- lineseg
